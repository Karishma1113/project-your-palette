                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Seasonal color palettes are used to determine what kinds of colors are best suited for an individual based on their eye color, hair color, and skin tone. These color palettes are categorized into different seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall) based on the tone of the colors in each palette.</p>

                <section class="problem">
                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>Information on seasonal color analysis is not easily or readily accessible to all individuals, especially for those with skin tones that are less represented online and in the media. This can make the process of understanding what colors would suit them, what makeup colors to use, and how to accessorize much more challenging for certain people who do not have access to this information or are unaware of seasonal color palettes. Historically, the fashion and beauty industries have focused predominantly on groups with lighter skin tones by catering products toward these individuals. Accessibility and inclusivity has been an ongoing issue for people with darker skin tones, and with finding a personal seasonal color palette, it is generally easier for those with lighter skin tones as having a higher level of contrast against different colors can make it easier to determine complementing shades (<a href="https://theconceptwardrobe.com/colour-analysis-comprehensive-guides/color-analysis-for-people-of-color">Colour Analysis for People of Colour</a>). Having a web app that takes hair color, skin tone and undertones, and eye color all into consideration to provide a color palette as accurate as possible would be helpful for people of all skin tones.</p>

                    <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
                    <p>One solution for this problem is based off of viral TikToks where content creators go to Korea and meet with professionals to get a color analysis done in person. Unfortunately, not everyone has the money nor time to be able to fly all the way to Korea to get this done. Although there are some resources online telling what color palettes match with what skin tone, this approach is more broad and doesn&apos;t give an aspect of feeling personalized towards you specifically. In addition, factors such as skin tone and undertones are not all represented equally on websites out there (<a href="https://www.dayblanc.kr/blogs/korean-styling-tip/personal-colour">Dayblanc</a>), and we want to ensure that people of all skin tones feel represented and catered to.</p>
