                    <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
                    <p>One solution for this problem is based off of viral TikToks where content creators go to Korea and meet with professionals to get a color analysis done in person. Unfortunately, not everyone has the money nor time to be able to fly all the way to Korea to get this done. Although there are some resources online telling what color palettes match with what skin tone, this approach is more broad and doesn&apos;t give an aspect of feeling personalized towards you specifically. In addition, factors such as skin tone and undertones are not all represented equally on websites out there (<a href="https://www.dayblanc.kr/blogs/korean-styling-tip/personal-colour">Dayblanc</a>), and we want to ensure that people of all skin tones feel represented and catered to.</p>

                    <p>The website can be accessed by anyone interested in learning more about their personalized color palette. The customizable features in this website will help promote diversity and inclusivity by providing color palettes that are inclusive of all skin tones. People of all different physical attributes can find the color palette best suited for them, which helps support minority groups that have skin tones that may not align with most mainstream fashion trends.</p>

                    <h2>Features</h2>
                    <p>The first feature that we will have is an interactive quiz where the user fills out questions regarding their physical attributes (skin tone, undertone, eye color, hair color) by selecting answers that apply to them. After completing the quiz, users will receive their results which will be the seasonal color palette best suited for them based on their answers. The results will provide the name of the color palette, a description, and a few example color shades part of the palette. The user can click on an expand option to see all the colors that are included in the palette. Our second feature will be a comparison page where users can compare two palettes based on a short description, warmth vs. coolness, the range of colors, diversity of shades and hues, what the dominant colors are, and examples of celebrities with the same palette. Since there are 12 seasonal color palettes, being able to compare them can help the user better understand why certain palettes work better for certain people, and why others may not work as well. Our half feature is a page dedicated to viewing all the possible season color palettes so the user can learn about all of them. On this page, the user can filter based on cool vs. warm palettes. Within the palettes, the user can also filter for specific colors, for example, just the pinks or the greens.</p>
