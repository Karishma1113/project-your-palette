                    <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
                    <p>One solution for this problem is based off of viral TikToks where content creators go to Korea and meet with professionals to get a color analysis done in person. Unfortunately, not everyone has the money nor time to be able to fly all the way to Korea to get this done. Although there are some resources online telling what color palettes match with what skin tone, this approach is more broad and doesn&apos;t give an aspect of feeling personalized towards you specifically. In addition, factors such as skin tone and undertones are not all represented equally on websites out there (<a href="https://www.dayblanc.kr/blogs/korean-styling-tip/personal-colour">Dayblanc</a>), and we want to ensure that people of all skin tones feel represented and catered to.</p>
